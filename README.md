**BioBuddy AI** is an advanced real time distress detection platform that analyzes voice and facial expressions to determine emotional states. Using classical AI + **quantum machine learning**, it can escalate critical scenarios to emergency services with exceptional precision.

This is not just another ML project, it’s a hybrid system with **quantum-backed classification, probabilistic escalation logic**, and **real-time AI vision/audio analysis**.
